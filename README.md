# DevConnect
DevConnect is a Full-Stack project with the aim of building a social media styled webapp using the MERN stack. 

Goal here is to brush up and demonstrate skills in regards to the MERN stack. In addition this App will act as a foundation to build a real working social network for devs to network, share work and get help with issues or answers to general questions. 

# Setup
`npm install`
`npm run dev`
